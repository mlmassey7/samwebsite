<h1><div class="head"> THE LIFE OF MY 9 YEAR OLD</h1>

	<img src="seanbaby.jpg" alt="Sean Baby Collage"></div>
	<div class="stuff">
	<h2><div class="head">BIO</h2><p>Sean Alonza Massey, aka SAM aka Scooter aka The Munchkin, is my super busy 9(almost 10) year old. He is an extremely energetic little guy. He likes to describe himself as handsome, a "babe-magnet" and a "dance-o-matic". He also says that he is the smartest kid in his school and the best skater on his team, so I am guess we can throw in the term "modest" as well...NOT. I kid! Sean is a great child. Born December 23rd 2006, he is a true Capricorn. You would be hard pressed to find a more determined, ambitious and helpful child. I got lucky. His dream is to one day be a lawyer, hockey player chef that owns a Chic-Fil-A.</p>

	<h2><div class="head"> HOME LIFE</h2>
		<p>Home life for Sean  is simple and kind of like a kid from a television series. One of those disney shows with the kid that is an all around "Rock Star", jock and super geek.  His household consist of a mom(me), a dad, a sister/aunt(long story), a cat and a dog. This pass summer, Sean requested that his allowance be raised from $5/wk to $20/wk. He needed more money to spend on those "babes" is my guess. To earn his newly increased allowance he had to take on a few chores, the most them is to take care of his beloved pets, Angel and MJ.
 
	<h3> SEAN'S PETS</h3>
		<h4>ANGEL THE CAT</h4>
		<p>The ever so photogenic Angel is our not so lovable, but gorgeous kitty. We found her pictures on <a href="https://www.petfinder.com/">PETFINDER</a> 8 years ago and we knew we had to have her. We, however, should have changed her name to "Princess" or maybe "The Queen" because that is what she thinks she is. She will only eat Fancy Feast...off of a plate...at the table AND she will only drink water if she sees you pour it out of a bottle. We love her, and she tolerates us(well Sean) because we feed her but she does not like the dog at all.</p>

		<h4> MJ THE DOG</h4>
		<p>We found MJ, aka Michael Jackson the dog, shivering in the back of a cage at <a href= "http://www.acctphilly.org/">PHILADELPHIA ANIMAL CARE & CONTROL CENTER.</a> We had gone there to drop off old sheets and towels for the the shelter and left with the most lovable and awesome dog ever!</p>

		<h2><div class="head"> PLAYTIME</h2>
		<p>Sean, like any child, likes to run and play when ever he has a free moment. However, we like to keep Sean busy so any down time he has is generally spent doing anything but chilling out. He fishes, swims, builds bikes and plays Ice Hockey. Sean plays for the <a href="http://www.sniderhockey.org/">Ed Snider Youth Hockey Foundation</a>. He has been with the organization since the age of 4. He currently plays on their squirt team in the <a href="http://www.dvhl.org/">Delaware Valley Hockey League</a> Check out the <a href="http://www.pointstreak.com/players/players-team-schedule.html?teamid=623939&seasonid=16082">team schedule</a> if you want to see when and where Sean and the Killer Bees will have their next game. </p>

		<p>When fishing he will catch the fish, but refuses to touch them. It's really funning, I'm hoping one day he will fish the job, because I don't like touching them either.</p>

	<h2><div class="head"> SCHOOL</h2>
	<img src="day1.jpg" alt="day1">
		<p>Since Sean is my pride and joy, he has attended private schools his whole life. He is currently enrolled as a 4th grader at an awesome private school, <a href="http://woodbineacademy.com/">WOODBINE ACADEMY</a> in the Wynnefield section of Philadelphia. Sean has been at the school for 3 years and loves his teacher Mrs. Johnson. One of the great things about Woodbine is that tuition includes music lessons at the prestigious <a href="www.settlementmusic.org">Settlement Music School</a>. Over the past 3 years, Sean has learned to play violin, drum and piano. The music teacher calls him Gregory Hines because he also loves to dance and sing.</p>

		<p>Sean is not only the star of our family, he is also a star at the school. At the end of the past 2 school years, Sean has received every award given. Top of the class in math reading and perfect attendance, if there is an award he has it. Including the one for community service that he earned for volunteering at the <a href="http://support.pancan.org/site/TR/PurpleStride/PurpleStride?fr_id=1141&pg=entry">Purple Stride for Pancreatic Cancer.</a> Who wouldn't love this kid?</p>
